  # Fix Project Visibility and Access

  1. Changes
    - Drop all existing project policies
    - Create new simplified policies that ensure visibility
    - Remove all recursive checks that could cause issues
    - Add proper indexes for performance

  2. Security
    - Allow proper project creation and visibility
    - Maintain data isolation between users
    - Keep proper access control
